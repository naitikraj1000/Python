# code  --> Byte code --> Machine code(Virtual Machine) --> Output
# Python is an interpreted language
# compiled python code is called Byte code(Low level code Not machine code and Platform independent)
# .pyc file is a compiled python file (Byte code)
# __pycache__ folder is a folder where all the compiled python files are stored 
# .pyc file works only for imported modules
# .pyc file is byte code of imported module
# .pyc file is created only if the imported module is changed
# .pyc file is created only if the imported module is imported
# __pycache store the .pyc file of imported module


# Python Virtual Machine is called PVM
# There is a infinite loop in PVM which keeps on running and executing the code
# Run time engine is the part of PVM which executes the code
# PVM is a stack based machine
# PVM is also knows as Interpreter


# Byte code is not a machine code (It is a low level code)

# Python version cpython, jython, ironpython, pypy, anaconda, stackless python
# cpython is the default python version
# cpython is written in C language
# cpython is the most popular python version
# cpython is the reference implementation of python
